# Airbnb Data Pipeline Overview

Welcome to the documentation for our **Airbnb Data Pipeline**. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the pipeline and serves as a reference for understanding the structure and flow of data within the system.

## Introduction

This data pipeline is designed to process and transform raw Airbnb data into a structured format suitable for analytics and reporting. The pipeline ingests raw input data from S3, performs data cleaning and transformation, and outputs analytical datasets that power dashboards and business insights.

## Input Data Schema

The input to our pipeline follows a specific schema which defines the structure and types of data fields collected from Airbnb listings and user interactions. Below is a visual representation of the input schema:

We hope this documentation helps you navigate and understand the structure and goals of our Airbnb pipeline effectively.
